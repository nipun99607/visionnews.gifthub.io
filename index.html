    <h3>Critical Analysis of JVP Policies</h3>
    <p>The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has a long history of armed uprisings and political violence, which has caused instability in Sri Lanka. While the party has evolved into parliamentary politics, its policy proposals often reflect radical shifts that could threaten economic and governance stability.</p>
    <p>Historical evidence from the 1971 and 1987–89 insurgencies shows a pattern of disrupting democratic institutions. Modern political engagement by the JVP should be analyzed carefully to ensure it aligns with national stability and democratic values.</p>
